  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. The default text editor on macOS and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive. If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, hit
    the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, followed by <kbd>:</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>+<kbd>!</kbd>
    (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark), then hitting <kbd>Return</kbd> to
    return to the shell.

    For the most part, we will just use the editor coming wit Jupyter Lab to edit files,
    so no need to install an extra editor.
